<div class="project-ideas">
    <p id="project Idea List">
    <br><br>1) Build a Multi-Page Responsive Website<br>

    A responsive website is one that can work on a variety of devices and screen sizes, on both mobile and desktop browsers. Today’s endless stream of new devices (laptops, smartphones, tablets) is making website responsiveness more crucial than ever. The way in which people view the web is changing, and as a result, building a site with a responsive design is the key to staying ahead of your competitors.<br>

    <br><br>2) Redesign an Existing Website Template<br>

    Building a website from start to finish may seem daunting at first. As you’re getting started, you may consider using a website template with predefined design elements, which will allow you to apply a responsive design to an existing template, without the need to create your own from the ground up.<br>

    <br><br>3) Design a Small JavaScript Game<br>

    Designing a small JavaScript game is a good test for any new developer — this is your chance to showcase what you can do with your skill set. When designing a game from scratch, there is no existing framework to build from, so you learn an incredible amount in the process, helping to make you a better developer as you work through the challenges. Plus, you’ll have a cool game to show off in your portfolio once you’re finished!<br>

    <br><br>4) Create a Simple Application<br>

    Creating an application is a great way to practice your coding skills. It can be hard to come up with new application ideas, but your first application doesn’t have to be complicated — it can be something as simple as a calculator or to-do list. New features are in constant development for today’s applications, so this is your chance to experiment with the latest advancements.<br>

    <br><br> 5) Random Number Generator<br>

    Coding a random number generator with Python is another great programming project idea. The goal of the application is to randomly generate a number at the user’s request. This project will test a new developer’s ability to use variants, integers, random function, input/output and other concepts.<br>

    <br><br>6) Web Scraping Using Python<br>

    Web scraping involves downloading structured data from the internet, choosing select data from that set and transitioning it into something else, like research, stories assets and more. This is a great project for Python beginners. Next time you come across data on the internet, with no direct way to download it, try using your Python skills to extract the data into a form that can be imported.<br>

    <br><br>7) Build a Working Chess Game<br>

    This is likely the most involved project on this list. Think about all the rules of chess; now think about coding them into a single web application! A game with this many variables with require complex algorithms and calculation. Creating your own chess game will give you hands-on experience in manipulating variants, artificial intelligence, input/output and more.<br>

    <br><br>8) Make Your Own Social Networking Website<br>

    If you’ve been learning PHP or Ruby on Rails, this is the perfect beginner project for you to practice your skills. Creating a social networking site will require you to build a database to store user account information, a script to produce unique profile pages and a design that is optimized and user-friendly.<br>

    <br><br>9) Build You Own Online Store<br>

    Creating an e-commerce store is another great way to practice your coding skills. The elements required for an online store are slightly more complex than a social networking site, since this project will need more than just a user database to function. Here, you will need to design a script to allow for a product page, shopping cart, checkout and other e-commerce-related elements.<br>

    <br><br>10) Contribute to an Open Source Project<br>

    Open ѕоurсе рrоjесtѕ are an incredible way for new developers to hone their skills. Not only do they offer a rewarding challenge, but you will have the opportunity to receive feedback from others without the pressure of working for an employer on a commercial product. Finally, contributing to an open source project gives you the chance to expand your network while making an impact in the coding community.<br>

    <br><br>11) Build an application like Quora. This app should have user authorization and authentication and walk through the complete Create, Read, Update, Destroy (CRUD) cycle.<br>

    <br><br>12) Demonstrate your handle on the intricacies of web socket development by building a chat application. If you’re feeling extra audacious, combine this with a little natural-language processing in the form of chatbots that answer questions from users.<br>

    <br><br>13) Try making a clone of Facebook. It surely won’t be as big or as streamlined, but even modest success allows you to show that you can handle working with databases, server-side scripting, front end frameworks, security protocols, and the rest of the full stack.<br>

    <br><br>14) Make an SEO-optimized website from the ground up with a popular framework like Ruby on Rails. There is no shortage of jobs for people who can do this kind of work.<br>

    <br><br>15) My research indicates that the creation of a custom content management system is a pretty major showcase of a web developer’s skill set. Do that, if you can.<br>

    <br><br>16) Game programming is different than web development, but you can make some really sophisticated games with HTML5 while still working through many of the basic requirements of a web development project.<br>

    <br><br>24) One-page layout<br>

    This project aims to recreate a pixel perfect design and make a one-page responsive layout. This is also a beginner-level project that allows freshers to test their newly acquired knowledge and skill level.<br>

    You can use the Conquer template to build this project. This template comes loaded with a host of unique layouts. Also, it brings before you a series of challenges that Web Developers often face in real-world scenarios. As a result, you are pushed to experiment with new technologies like Floats and Flexbox to hone the implementation of CSS layout techniques.<br>


    <br><br>25) Login authentication<br>

    This is a beginner-level project that is great for honing your JavaScript skills. In this project, you will design a website’s login authentication bar – where users enter their email ID/username and password to log in to the site. Since almost every website now comes with a login authentication feature, learning this skill will come in handy in your future web projects and applications.<br>


    <br><br>26) Product landing page<br>

    To develop a product landing page of a website, you must have sound knowledge of HTML and CSS. In this project, you will create columns and align the components of the landing page within the columns. You will have to perform basic editing tasks like cropping and resizing images, using design templates to make the layout more appealing, and so on.<br>



    <br><br>27) Giphy with a unique API<br>

    This project involves developing a web application that uses search inputs and Giphy API for presenting GIFs on a webpage. This is an excellent beginner-level project wherein you use the Giphy API to recreate the Giphy website. We recommend you to use the Giphy API since you need not request for any API key to use it. Another advantage of using the Giphy API is that you don’t require to worry about configuration while requesting data.<br>

    You can use the Giphy API to build a web application that has a search input where users can search for specific GIFs, can display trending GIFs in a column/grid format, and has a load more option at the bottom for searching more GIFs.<br>


    <br><br>28) JavaScript quiz game<br>

    This web development project aims to create a JavaScript quiz game that can take multiple answers and show the correct result to users. While gaining JavaScript knowledge isn’t tricky, applying that knowledge in real-world scenarios is usually challenging. However, you can experiment with your skills by working on a small JavaScript-based quiz game.<br>

    While building this project, you will not only deal with complex logic, but you will also learn a lot about data management and DOM manipulation. Depending on your JavaScript skills and ability to handle complex logic, you can make the game as simple or complicated as you want it to be!<br>


    <br><br>29) To-do list<br>

    You can use JavaScript to build a web app that allows you to make to-do lists for routine tasks. For this project, you must be well-versed with HTML and CSS. JavaScript is the best choice for a to-do project since it allows users to design interactive coding lists where you can add, delete, and also group items.<br>

    <br><br>30) SEO-friendly website<br>

    Today, SEO is an integral part of website building. Without SEO, your website will not have the visibility to drive traffic from organic searches in SERPs (search engine result pages). While Web Developers are primarily concerned about the website functionality, they must have a basic idea of web design and SEO. In this project, you will take up the role of a Digital Marketer and gain in-depth knowledge of SEO. It will be helpful if you are aware of the technical SEO for this project.<br>

    When you are well-versed in SEO, you can build a website having user-friendly URLs and featuring an integrated, responsive design. This will allow the site to load quickly on both desktop or mobile devices, thereby strengthening a brand’s social media presence.<br>


    <br><br>31) JavaScript drawing<br>

    This project is inspired by Infinite Rainbow on CodePen. This JavaScript-based project uses JavaScript as a drawing tool to bring to life HTML and CSS elements on a web browser. The best thing about this project is that you can take advantage of JavaScript’s supercool drawing libraries like oCanvas, Canviz, Raphael, etc.<br>

    By working on this project, you can learn how to use and implement JavaScript’s drawing capabilities. This skill will come in handy for enhancing the appeal of static pages by adding graphical elements to them.<br>


    <br><br>32) Search engine result page<br>

    This is a super interesting and exciting project! In this project, you have to create a search engine result page that resembles Google’s SERPs. While building this project, you must ensure that the webpage can display at least ten search results (just like Google). Also, you must include the navigation arrow at the bottom of the webpage so that users can switch to the next page.<br>


    <br><br>33)  Google home page lookalike

    Another interesting JavaScript project on our list, this project requires you to build a webpage that resembles Google’s home page. Keep in mind that you have to build a replica of Google home page along with the Google logo, search icons, text box, Gmail, and images buttons – basically, everything that you see on Google’s home page. This should be relatively easy, provided you proficient in HTML and CSS.<br>

    Since the aim here is to build a replica of Google’s home page, you need not worry too much about the functionality of the components of the page.<br>


    <br><br>34) Tribute page

    Yes, tribute pages are a real thing. If you Google “tribute page,” you will find a comprehensive list of links showing you how to build tribute pages. Essentially a tribute page is a webpage dedicated in honor of someone you love, admire, or respect. It can be a person or a beloved pet.<br>

    A tribute page is a perfect project for sharpening your HTML and CSS skills and knowledge. In this project, you will make a webpage where you can write and dedicate a tribute to someone and publish the same. Apart from the writeup for the tribute, you need to add relevant images, links, etc., on the page.<br>


    <br><br>35) Survey form

    Building a survey form or questionnaire is easy if you are proficient in HTML or HTML5. Even today, lots of companies use survey forms as a means of collecting relevant data about their target audience.<br>

    In this project, you will have to design a full-fledged survey form that includes relevant questions like name, age, email, address, contact number, and other questions, depending on the type of company or organization you are shaping the form. This project will put to the test your webpage structuring skills<br>


    <br><br>36) Exit plugin

    In this project, you will design an exit widget or plugin. When you visit a website or a webpage, you must have seen the tiny pop-ups that show on the screen when you wish to exit the site/page. Companies usually use exit plugins to show exciting offers to keep a user on the page. This is precisely what you have to design.<br>

    You can use your JavaScript and skills to design unique exit plugins wherein the content will be customized based on how long the user stays on a page.<br>


    <br><br>37) Note log<br>

    This project will be much like the to-do list project we’ve mentioned above. The aim here is to design and build a notes app that can take multiple entries per note. It should allow users to select a note when they launch the app. When they choose a note, a new entry will be automatically tagged along with the current date, time, and location. Users can also sort and filter their entries based on this metadata.<br>

    This is a great web app for tracking events and resolving messy calendar problems.<br>


    <br><br>38) Social share buttons<br>

    Most websites (particularly, content-based ones) built on WordPress have social share buttons that allow users to share content on various social media platforms. However, for static sites that aren’t based on WordPress, adding social share buttons is a challenge.<br>

    In this project, you will take up the challenge of writing a JavaScript code that will allow you to add social share buttons to static sites. While you can do this by incorporating HTML elements or images in the site’s template, using JavaScript allows you to add the share buttons dynamically.<br>


    <br><br>39) Toast notifications<br>

    A toast notification is an unobtrusive and non-modal window element that is used to display brief, auto-expiring information to users. You can see toast notifications primarily on Android OS platforms.<br>

    In this project, you will be required to design a toast notification tool. Using your JavaScript skills and knowledge, you’ve to create a functional toast notification tool that can respond to events on the page and notify the users as and when an event has completed successfully. You could also use the setTimeout function to represent the delay in loading or saving data.<br>


    <br><br>40) AJAX-style login<br>

    The focus of this project is to build the front-end of an AJAX-style login site/page. In AJAX-style login, the login page does not need to be reloaded to ensure whether or not you have to input the correct login details.<br>

    If you want, you can also create a mockup of both successful and invalid login situations by hard-coding a username and password and compare this to the information entered by a user. You can also include error messages for situations where the input data is incorrect or not found.<br>


    <br><br>41) Word counter<br>

    This is a nifty tool for people who write detailed documentation, blogs, essays, etc., online. A word counter tool allows you to see how many words you’ve written so far and how much more you need to write.<br>

    This is a pretty simple project which requires you to build an application that can parse texts and show the number of words and characters contained in a writeup. You can also include additional functionality in the word counter to provide more advanced information such as the number of passive sentences in a block of text.<br>


    <br><br>42) Countdown timer<br>

    Another simple project on our list is a countdown timer or clock. For this project, you just need to create a simple webpage that can update the time every second. With JavaScript as its foundation, you can make the page more appealing by including start, stop, and pause buttons on the page.<br>


    <br><br>43) Modal pop-ups<br>

    This project is very similar to the social share button project. Here, you need to create a JavaScript code that will be immediately triggered every time a user clicks a button on the page or loads the page. <br>

    You will design modal pop-ups to provide notifications, promotions, and email signups to users. The pop-up should be such that it can be closed with a click as well. To make the project more challenging, you can experiment with different animations and modal entrances like fade-in and slide-out. <br>


    <br><br>44) Address book<br>

    In this project, you have to build an application that can search for particular entries in your address book by filtering the attributes you specify.<br>

    You can either use an API that generates placeholder data, or you can also structure the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Once the data is in place, you must load it in your application by using an AJAX request (jQuery or XML HTTP request) just as you would in a real-world application. Also, you can design the web application to cache requests in the local storage to avoid unnecessary network requests.<br>
